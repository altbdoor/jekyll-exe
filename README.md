I was working on a project which is pretty much static. [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/) comes to mind as I have had a good experience with GitHub and Jekyll, but [setting it up on Windows is a lot of trouble](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/). I found a blog on [building a jekyll.exe for Windows](http://www.nickw.it/jekyll-dot-exe/), but only v1.2.0 was available, and it is too old for my use. With the blog tutorial as reference, I successfully built [v2.5.3](https://github.com/altbdoor/jekyll-exe/tree/v2.5.x).

For downloads, check the [releases page](https://github.com/altbdoor/jekyll-exe/releases).

My heartfelt thanks to the other developers and projects for making this possible.
